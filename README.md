# Keysmith

Keysmith is a password tool which does much the same as Bitwarden, 1Password etc. but saves the passwords in a folder containing JSON files per entry where the values are encrypted. So you can sync it using Google Drive or DropBox or S3 or SFTP or anything else you want.

So it would need an Electron App maybe and definitely browser plugins. So this one's a frontend heavy one.
